# Creamy Halibut with Lemon and Leek
**Serves:** 2  
**Preparation time:** 10 minutes  
**Cooking time:** 1 hour

## Ingredients
- 400 g halibut, sliced into 2 cm thick pieces  
- 1 lemon  
- 2 tubs (approx. 300 ml total) crème fraîche  
- 1 leek *(optional)*  
- Butter, for frying  

## Instructions
1. **Prepare the pan:** Use a frying pan with a lid. Add a small knob of butter and heat gently over medium heat.
2. **Arrange the fish:** Place the halibut slices in the pan in a single layer, making sure they don’t overlap.
3. **Add lemon:** Slice the lemon into thin rounds, then halve the slices. Tuck the lemon pieces between the halibut slices.
4. **Optional leek:** If using leek, slice it thinly and scatter it evenly over the fish.
5. **Add crème fraîche:** Pour the crème fraîche over the fish, lemon, and leek, spreading it out evenly.
6. **Cook gently:** Cover the pan with a lid and let the dish simmer over medium heat for about one hour. Avoid stirring to keep the fish intact.
